# Question 1: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
# Question 2: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
# Question 3: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The variable that provides a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values is the vehicale weight. I came to
this conclusion after looking at the different standard errors that each dependent variables gave. The slope of
the linear model is not considered to be zero after looking at the generated yvals_multi we can see that the
values decrease then increase at a staggered rate noting a change in slope for each dependent values. The linear
model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectivley after referencing our p-value. Our p-value being a
low number notes that our our null hypothesis is bad therfore we reject our null hypothesis.

# The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not 
# ...exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

The current manufacturing data does meet the design specification from our psi_summary results we can see
that the variance_psi is lower than 100 pounds per inch which meets the design specification.

# small writeup of your interpretation and findings for the t-test results.

I did a One-Sample t-Test for the reason that we are doing our analysis per a population mean result of
1,500 pounds per inch. We can see that our p-value has a high p-value which means that our null hypothesis
is true.

# Design My Own Study

I would recommend to have a study with cost and fuel efficiency. Questions to ask for these two would be:
How efficient is the fuel? How many miles per gallon would you get on the car? What is a typical car fuel
efficiency? Compare the cost and fuel efficiency with our MechaCar Prototype to help us determine if 
design is viable. We would do a Two-Sample t-Test since we will be comparing our Prototype data with
typical/common vehical types.
